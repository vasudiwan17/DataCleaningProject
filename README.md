# DataCleaningProject
my first data cleaning project in python 
Data Cleaning Summary
1. Removed Duplicates – Deleted all duplicate rows from the dataset.
2. Handled Missing Values – Filled null values in the Income column with the median.
3. Standardized Categories – Made Education and Marital_Status values consistent (e.g., lowercase, no extra spaces).
4. Formatted Dates – Converted Dt_Customer column to a standard dd-mm-yyyy format.
5. Renamed Columns – Changed column headers to clean, uniform names (lowercase, no spaces).
6. Fixed Data Types – Ensured Age is integer and Dt_Customer is datetime.
7. Final Output – Saved cleaned dataset as dataset_cleaned.csv.
